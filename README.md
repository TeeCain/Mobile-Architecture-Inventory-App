# Mobile-Architecture-Inventory-App

The Mobile2App Company is developing an inventory management application to streamline warehouse operations, aiming to provide a comprehensive solution for efficient inventory tracking and management. The app's key features include a robust database with tables for inventory items and user credentials, a user-friendly login screen facilitating initial logins and account creation, and a grid-based display screen for a comprehensive view of all inventory items. Users will be able to add, remove, and modify inventory items, as well as adjust quantities dynamically to manage stock levels effectively.

One of the app's unique aspects is its proactive notification system, which alerts users when an item's quantity reaches zero, ensuring timely replenishment and preventing operational disruptions. By addressing these requirements, the Inventory App aims to enhance warehouse management capabilities, offering a user-friendly interface and efficient tools for inventory control.

To create a user-centered UI, the app's screens and features align with Android Design and Quality Guidelines. The login/registration screen allows users to log in or register for a new account, with secure password requirements and validation. The inventory list screen displays all items with search, filter, and sorting options, while the add item screen enables users to add new items with ease. The notification settings screen allows users to customize notification preferences, ensuring they receive relevant alerts.

During coding, industry standards were followed, resulting in clean, well-documented code. Regular testing was conducted using the Android Studio emulator to identify and fix bugs. Innovation was necessary in utilizing the built-in Login Activity to simplify the creation of a login feature backed by a user credentials database. I was particularly successful at the implementation of "Intents," allowing users to navigate to different screens with button clicks.
